# gol
A Conway's Game of Life implementation in C++ using Raylib

## controls
* space - pause/play toggle
* s - move forward one step
* c - clear map

## build instructions
The program is compiled by running `build.sh` on Unix/Linux based machines. In order to compile on Windows/MacOs the script will probably have to be modified.

In order for the program to compile the Raylib library must be installed on your machine. This can be done on Arch Linux/Manjaro based machines with the command `sudo pacman -S raylib`. Unfortunately, for other operating systems you will have to figure this step out yourself.
